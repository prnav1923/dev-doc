PROJECT 1: DevDocs Navigator
AI-Powered Documentation Assistant with LLM Evaluation
Problem Statement:
Gen AI and ML engineers waste 2-3 hours/week searching through LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Pandas documentation. DevDocs Navigator reduces lookup time by 70% using agentic retrieval and LLM-based answer validation.
What You'll Build:
* Agentic RAG system using LangGraph for intelligent document retrieval
* LLM-as-judge evaluation framework using LangSmith
* Multi-library support (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Pandas docs)
* Real-time answer validation and accuracy scoring
* Streamlit UI with evaluation dashboards
Tech Stack:
* Gen AI: LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, Gemini
* Vector DB: FAISS
* Frontend: Streamlit
* MLOps: Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD
* Cloud: AWS EC2 or GCP Cloud Run
* Monitoring: LangSmith tracing + custom logging
Key Features:
✅ Agentic decision-making (when to retrieve vs generate) ✅ LLM-as-judge for answer quality evaluation ✅ Source citation with links to official docs ✅ Benchmark results (95%+ accuracy on 50 test questions) ✅ Deployed with Docker + CI/CD pipeline
Skills Demonstrated:
* Gen AI (RAG, agents, LLM evaluation)
* LangChain ecosystem mastery
* Production deployment
* Docker & CI/CD
* Cloud deployment
